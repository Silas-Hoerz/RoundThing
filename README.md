**Never build ugly circles again! RoundThing is a Minecraft (Paper/Folia) plugin that visualizes perfect, block-snapped circles, spheres, and rings with particles as the ultimate building guide.**

This plugin is your personal architect for all circular construction projects. It helps players visualize mathematically perfect shapes by displaying a grid of particles exactly where blocks need to be placed. The result is flawless structures without the headache.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Two Shape Types:** Create detailed **Circles** and **Spheres**.
- **Block-Perfect:** Particles always snap to the center of a block, creating a clear "stair-step effect" as a perfect building template.
- **Full 3D Control:** Freely rotate circles in 3D space! Tilt them on the X and Z axes (`-90¬∞` to `+90¬∞`) to create vertical rings, diagonal platforms, and more.
- **Thickness & Filling:** Create thick rings or completely filled disks and spheres.
- **Persistent Storage:** Every shape created by a player is saved and survives a server restart.
- **Server Protection:** A configurable per-player particle limit prevents the server from being overloaded by too many particles.
- **Fully Configurable:** Admins can adjust the limit at any time in-game or in the `config.yml`.
- **Multilingual (i18n):** Automatically adapts to the player's client language. (Supports English, German, Spanish, French, Chinese, Russian, and many more out of the box).
- **Intelligent Commands:** Thanks to tab-completion, commands, shape names, colors, and coordinates are suggested as you type.
